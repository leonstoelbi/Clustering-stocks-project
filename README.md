Comparison of the prices of the NASDAQ 100 and the SP 500 stocks according to their dependency on the market, oil, gold and natural gas. 

Please read the README file before running the program.

This program is doing the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6. Visualizes the results with pie charts for every industry showing the number stocks per group. 


Before you run the program please consider the following before you run the program:
1. Since every part creates necessary files for the following steps, you have to run the individual programs in the correct order (01 to 06)
2. NASDAQ clustering and SP 500 culstering are seperated, therefore run both programs and compare results afterwards
